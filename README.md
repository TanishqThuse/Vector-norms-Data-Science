# Vector Norms in Data Science  

This repository contains **presentations (PPTs) and code** that explain **vector norms**, their mathematical definitions, and their role in machine learning, optimization, and deep learning.  

## ðŸ“Œ Contents  
- ðŸ“Š **Presentations**: Slide decks explaining different vector norms.  
- ðŸ’» **Code Examples**: Implementations of vector norms using Python.  

## ðŸ”¢ **What are Vector Norms?**  
Vector norms are mathematical functions that measure the **size** or **length** of vectors. They are crucial in machine learning for optimization, regularization, and distance calculations.  

### **Types of Norms Covered**  
1. **L1 Norm (Manhattan Norm)** â€“ Measures absolute distance.  
2. **L2 Norm (Euclidean Norm)** â€“ Measures straight-line distance.  
3. **Lp Norm** â€“ Generalized form of L1 and L2.  
4. **Lâˆž Norm (Max Norm)** â€“ Takes the maximum absolute value.  
5. **Frobenius Norm** â€“ Used for matrices, similar to L2 norm.  

## ðŸš€ **Usage**  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vector-norms-data-science.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
  ```bash
  cd vector-norms-data-science
  ```

3. Run the Python code to see vector norm calculations in action.
